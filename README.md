In other words, Market Basket Analysis enables merchants to find links between the products that customers purchase.
## Objectives:
•	Analyze the  data of 500k orders covering all transactions made by a UK-based and registered non-store internet.

## We have performed:
1) EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
2) VISUALIZATION
3) MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM
## Apriori Algorithm:
Apriori algorithm assumes that any subset of a frequent item set must be frequent. Its the algorithm behind Market Basket Analysis.Say, a transaction containing {Grapes, Apple, Mango} also contains {Grapes, Mango}. So, according to the principle of Apriori, if {Grapes, Apple, Mango} is frequent, then {Grapes, Mango} must also be frequent.
## Association Rule Mining:
Association Rule Mining is used when we want to find an association between different objects in a set, find frequent patterns.
The most common approach to find these patterns is Market Basket Analysis, which is a key technique used by large retailers like Amazon, Flipkart, etc to analyze customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets”. The discovery of these associations can help retailers develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers.
## Association VS Recommendation:
 “Frequently Bought Together” → Association
 
 “Customers who bought this item also bought” → Recommendation
